## **Blockly With BITalino**

Blockly with BITalino is a joint venture between two final year Masters students in the School of Computing & Communications at Lancaster University (www.lancaster.ac.uk/scc), and PLUX. 

The software was created and developed by Rhys Brady, and the documentation was written by Luke Brown, both supervised by Dr. Jason Alexander.

**What is The Project?**

The project allows for the graphical processing of data sent from the "BITalino", a Biosignal monitoring toolkit capable of collecting data ranging from muscle movement to brain activity. This graphical processing is powered by "Blockly" a toolkit that enables scratch-like programming.

**Documentation**

Documentation created is also available in the Assets folder.

**Working Example**
